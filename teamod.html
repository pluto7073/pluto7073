			Additions: Tea! All Kinds!<br>
			Craft a TeaLeaf with String and paper to get a tea bag<br>
			Craft The Tea bag with a glass bottle and a water bucket<br>
			to get tea. Tea does nothing but act like a bottle of<br>
			water on its own. If you craft tea with a notch apple<br>
			you can get Notch Tea, Which is like a better version of<br>
			A golden apple. You can also craft two other types of tea<br>
			bags. If you craft a dried tea leaf with paper, string, and<br>
			a gold melon to get a healing tea bag. Craft this with water,<br>
			and a glass bottle to get healing tea. When drank, this tea<br>
			will give you instant health and saturation for 1 Minute<br>
			Another kind of tea bag/tea is breakfast tea. This is <br>
			basically like the Coffee From my coffee mod. Craft the <br>
			tea bag by crafting dried tea leaves with string, paper,<br>
			and sugar to get a Breakfast tea bag. Craft this like normal<br>
			tea and you get the blue Breakfast tea. Tea leaves are grown<br>
			using tea seeds. Then the leaves are dried on a campfire to <br>
			get dried tea leaves<br> <br> <br>
